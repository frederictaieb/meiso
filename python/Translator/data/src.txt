The nine centers are energy hubs that transform or transmute the life force as it flows through the BodyGraph. The overview on the opposite page will introduce you to each of the nine centers by name, its distinguishing function(s), and its location within the BodyGraph.
Please note that the Root and the Solar Plexus Centers each appear in two categories. Each ofthe nine centers will be covered in more detail later in this section.

ONE MANIFESTATION CENTER: ''All roads lead to Rome." The Throat Center establishes the context for our discussion ofthe nine centers. Its extraordinary and unique function is similar to that of a town square. All energy is being moved through the other eight centers toward the Throat, where it is given a 'voice' as a means to physically manifest and!or verbally communicate our human intelligence. The Throat Center is how we express precisely what it means to be a differentiated hwnan being at the top of the food chain.
Two PRESSURE CENTERS: The Head and Root Centers are two pressure sources that move the energy toward the three Awareness Centers. They are the pressures to 'know' and to 'do,' to think and to stay alive. The Head asks the question which moves the energy on to the Ajna to conceptualize the answer. Root pressure provides the adrenalized drive to survive, the momentum for moving life forward. This fuel is a potent energy which is sent on to, and further refined by the Splenic, Solar Plexus and Sacral Centers, on its way to the Throat where it will be communicated or acted upon.

THREE AWARENESS CENTERS: The Splenic, Ajna, and Solar Plexus Centers are three potential areas of self-consciousness and self-awareness. Each focuses and interprets our life experiences energetically as body, mind or spirit awareness. (The other six centers function at a mechanical level.) Upon reaching the Throat, the energy becomes an expression of our conscious intelligence: either as Splenic intelligence (survival awareness) or as mental intelligence (cognitive awareness) or as emotional/spirit intelligence (relational/social awareness).

FouR MOTOR (ENERGY) CENTERS:TheRoot,SolarPlexus,SacralandHeart Centers are motors; specific frequencies that provide us with the energy resources needed to manifest our life. The Root provides us with momentum to keep going. The emotional wave of the Solar Plexus provides us with the impetus of desire for more experience, for intimacy in relationships, and for spirit awareness. In the Sacral we have the generative energy to support the continuation of the Form, the creative life force. The Heart is the motor energy behind the "I, me, mine," the source ofour willpower. It insures our survival on the material plain through communal hierarchies.

ONE IDENTITY CENTER: Ihe G Center is home to the Magnetic Monopole. Strategically located in the BodyGraph as the center of the Mandala, it establishes our identity as a direction through time in space called our geometry. This is where our own unique energy flow or definition connects to the flow of all life - or how we are wired to the Universe. The Magnetic Monopole pulls our life toward us. W e might say the universe lives life through us.


You will notice in the BodyGraph that some of the centers are colored in, or defined, and some are not colored in, or undefined. The centers that are defined are fixed and reliable in the way in which they function and operate. The centers that are undefined (white) are the places in which you experience outside influences or conditioning. The undefined centers are not broken, they are not empty, and they do not need to be fixed. They are places where we are vulnerable to conditioning, and areas to learn and gather wisdom. Each of us are made up of a mix between what is defined and what is undefned. This is not a question of it being good or bad. The defined parts of us represent the student living the life, and what is undefined represents where we are going to school - the school of life. The process of becoming yourself is a process of recognizing where we are taking in conditioning in life, how it affects us, and how to put it in its proper context. The opportunity for wisdom lies in this recognition.
